# Python To-Do List
A simple to-do list project built with Python. It allows you to:
- Add tasks
- List all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit task titles
- Remove tasks
Each task has a title and a completion status indicator.
All tasks are saved to a file (tasks.json) when exiting the program.

# Future Improvements
-Automatically save tasks after each action
-Add confirmation prompts before deleting tasks
-Include creation dates for tasks
-Filter tasks by completed or pending status
-Add task priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
-Implement quick search by task name
-Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
-Add a login system for multiple users
-Integrate with a database for persistent storage
